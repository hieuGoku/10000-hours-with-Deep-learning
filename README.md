# **Learn2Deep: From Basic to Advanced Deep Learning**

This is a Git repository contributed by me and [minhtuanletu](https://github.com/minhtuanletu). We share knowledge about deep learning with everyone. We primarily focus on Computer Vision (**me**) and Natural Language Processing (**minhtuanletu**). Hopefully, it will be helpful to others.

Anyone can contribute to this project, and we acknowledge and appreciate your contributions <3

( *I will continue until I get a new job :v* )
